    Hi, Welcome to my blog! My name is Dinara (aka Dina) Sagitova.
    I am a software developer passionate about web and database technology.

    <br><br>
    Before I became a software developer, I studied Biochemistry at
    <a href="https://www.umbc.edu/" target="_blank">UMBC</a>.

    I fell in love with programming while working at a bioinformatics lab
    (<a href="https://erilllab.umbc.edu/" target="_blank">Erill Lab</a>)
    as a project coordinator and a database curator.

    This newfound passion inspired me to earn a degree in Computer Science (BS).

    <br><br>

    Since then I also worked as a software developer at a financial firm developing a
    loan origination platform and at the Research Information Technology Systems (RITS)
    center at Johns Hopkins University.

    <br><br>

    This is a personal blog to write about software development,
    and occasionally, about fun things I do in life, in general.

  </p>
